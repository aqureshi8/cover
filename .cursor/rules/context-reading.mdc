# Context Reading Rule: AI_CONTEXT.md Files

Always read all relevant AI_CONTEXT.md files when working with the codebase, starting with the root AI_CONTEXT.md file.

## Reading Strategy:
1. **Start with root AI_CONTEXT.md** - Always read the project root AI_CONTEXT.md first to understand the overall project structure
2. **Read relevant folder contexts** - When working in specific folders, read their AI_CONTEXT.md files to understand the folder's purpose and contents
3. **Read parent contexts** - When working in subfolders, read parent folder AI_CONTEXT.md files to understand the broader context
4. **Update context understanding** - Use the information from AI_CONTEXT.md files to inform code decisions and understand the codebase architecture

## When to Read Context Files:
- Before starting any new feature or modification
- When exploring unfamiliar parts of the codebase
- When making architectural decisions
- When adding new files or folders
- When refactoring existing code

## How to Use Context Information:
- Understand the purpose and role of each folder
- Identify the right location for new files
- Understand existing patterns and conventions
- Make informed decisions about code organization
- Maintain consistency with the established project structure

This ensures that all code changes align with the documented project structure and purpose.
