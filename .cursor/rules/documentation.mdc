# Documentation Rule: AI_CONTEXT.md Files

Always create and maintain AI_CONTEXT.md files for all folders in the project. These files should contain:

## Required Content:
1. **High-level information about the folder's purpose and role in the project**
2. **Brief descriptions of immediate subdirectories and files** (no more than one line each)

## Format Guidelines:
- Use clear, concise language
- Focus on the "why" and "what" rather than implementation details
- Keep subdirectory/file descriptions to a single line maximum
- Update the file whenever you add, remove, or significantly modify files/folders

## Example Structure:
```markdown
# AI_CONTEXT.md

## Folder Purpose
This folder contains [brief description of the folder's role in the project].

## Contents
- `subfolder1/` - [one-line description]
- `subfolder2/` - [one-line description]
- `file1.js` - [one-line description]
- `file2.ts` - [one-line description]
```

## When to Create/Update:
- When creating a new folder
- When adding new files or subdirectories
- When significantly changing the purpose of existing files/folders
- When the folder structure changes

This documentation helps maintain project clarity and assists AI tools in understanding the codebase structure.
